> **Evolution of Recommender Systems with Ranking-Based Approach and LLM Embeddings**

This repository contains the implementation of a hybrid Recommender System that integrates **Large Language Model (LLM)** embeddings to improve ranking performance. It is built upon the DIRECT framework but significantly refactored to support state-of-the-art semantic representations and efficient training pipelines.

## 🌟 Key Features & Engineering

Unlike standard implementations, this project focuses on **scalability**, **ranking optimization**, and **software engineering best practices**:

* **LLM Integration (T5-Gemma):** Replaced legacy BERT embeddings with **google/t5gemma-2b**, enabling superior semantic understanding of user reviews and item descriptions.
* **Offline Pre-calculation Pipeline:** Designed a multi-stage data ingestion pipeline (`precompute_embeddings.py` and `consolidate_embeddings.py`) to generate and store 100GB+ of embeddings offline. This removes the runtime bottleneck of LLM forward passes, drastically speeding up training.
* **Ranking-Oriented Loss (BPR):** Refactored the training objective from simple rating prediction (MSE) to **Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) Loss**, aligning the model optimization with the ranking task (Top-K recommendation).
* **Memory Optimization:** Implemented a custom `MetaIndex` loader that handles massive embedding matrices efficiently using direct RAM allocation strategies (replacing standard memory mapping for performance gains on high-memory nodes).

## 📂 Repository Structure

* `Main_T5Gemma.py`: Main entry point for training and grid search.
* `Test_Embeddings.py`: Script for evaluating trained models and testing embedding quality.
* `models/DIRECT.py`: Refactored model architecture (Encoder removed to accept pre-computed embeddings).
* `models/Losses.py`: Implementation of BPR Loss.
* `precompute_embeddings.py`: Script to generate T5-Gemma embeddings from raw text using batch processing.
* `consolidate_embeddings.py`: Utility to merge fragmented batch files into unified NumPy arrays for fast loading.
* `cache_model.py`: Helper script to download and cache the LLM locally.
* `datas/`: Data loading logic and custom `Dataset` classes.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/AMarz4400/llm-ranking-direct.git](https://github.com/AMarz4400/llm-ranking-direct.git)
cd llm-ranking-direct

# Install core dependencies and setup datasets
# This script handles PyTorch Nightly, Transformers (GitHub), and NLTK data
sh gemma_setup.sh

# Install remaining utilities
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Data Preparation Pipeline
This project requires a multi-step data preparation to handle the LLM computational load upfront.

Step A: Download & Setup Downloads datasets (Amazon Reviews), installs NLTK data, and caches the T5-Gemma model.

Bash

sh gemma_setup.sh
Step B: Pre-compute Embeddings Generates semantic embeddings for Users and Items using T5-Gemma. Requires GPU.

Bash

python precompute_embeddings.py
Step C: Consolidate Data Merges the thousands of batch files generated in Step B into optimized .npy binaries for fast training access.

Bash

python consolidate_embeddings.py
🚀 Usage
Training (BPR Loss)
To train the model using the BPR ranking setup on the pre-computed data:

Bash

python Main_T5Gemma.py train \
    --lr 0.0001 \
    --setup BPR \
    --datafile ./datasets/reviews_Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5.json \
    --aspc_num 5 \
    --num_epochs 50
Hyperparameter Grid Search
To run a Grid Search for hyperparameter optimization (saves results in outputs/):

Bash

python Main_T5Gemma.py grid \
    --setup BPR \
    --datafile ./datasets/reviews_Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5.json
Evaluation & Testing
To evaluate a trained model checkpoint:

Bash

python Test_Embeddings.py test \
    --lr 0.0001 \
    --setup BPR \
    --datafile ./datasets/reviews_Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5.json \
    --parameters "./outputs/reviews_Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5/YOUR_BEST_MODEL.pth"
📊 Performance
By switching to BPR Loss and T5-Gemma embeddings, the model achieves improved results on sparse datasets compared to traditional baselines, on ranking metrics like Recall, Precision, Hit Rate.
